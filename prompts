Problem statement root_cause cluster analysis:


So I have data like this: its a df:

Date Loss_id, Loss_description, loss_root_causes, loss_root_causes_embeddings

Date is datetime
Loss id is a string,
Loss description is string
loss_root_causes is list of string, where string are sentences
root_causes_embeddings is list of numpy high dimensional vectors that represent meaning of root causes of that row in vectors.


Now the goal is 
Given user provides starting date and ending date:
We are able to do concentration analysis which allows showing things in this way:
Sentence 1: rank score: linked with losses id: loss id are linked with loss description
Sentence 2: rank score: linked with losses id: loss id are linked with loss description
So on. 

Return a nested json.

Give me best solution for this problem which is most accurate, it can be bit slow but I want most accurate solution
