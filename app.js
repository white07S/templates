Good you asked — this trips up a lot of people.
Good question 👍

When you install Milvus Standalone from the .deb package, it expects a few system-level dependencies already present. The error you’re seeing (libopenblas0 is not installed) is because Milvus relies on BLAS/LAPACK for vector math.

Here’s a checklist of prerequisites you should have before installing the Milvus .deb package:

⸻

✅ System Dependencies

Install these before running the .deb:

sudo apt-get update

# Math libraries
sudo apt-get install -y libopenblas0 liblapack3

# C++ runtime libraries
sudo apt-get install -y libgomp1 libstdc++6

# Networking + utilities
sudo apt-get install -y curl wget ca-certificates


⸻

✅ Milvus-specific runtime
	•	Etcd – Milvus uses etcd for metadata. The standalone .deb might bundle it, but in many setups you need it separately.
	•	MinIO (or other object storage) – for vector data persistence. In standalone .deb, it usually expects MinIO or local storage.
	•	Docker/Podman (optional) – not needed for .deb, only for containerized install.

⸻

✅ Python client (if you plan to interact locally)

pip install pymilvus


⸻

🔍 Verify your missing dependency

Run:

ldd /usr/bin/milvus  | grep "not found"

This will show all missing libraries that you need to install.

⸻

👉 My recommendation: start with installing libopenblas0 to fix your current issue:

sudo apt-get install -y libopenblas0


⸻

Do you want me to prepare a complete install script that sets up all dependencies + Milvus standalone from .deb in one go?


----------

	nohup /usr/bin/milvus run standalone > milvus.log 2>&1 &
👉 Milvus itself does not install MinIO or etcd when you install from the RPM/DEB binary package.

Here’s the breakdown:
	•	Docker Compose / Helm chart versions of Milvus → yes, they bundle MinIO + etcd automatically as side-containers. You don’t have to install them separately in those modes.
	•	Bare metal / DEB / RPM package → only the milvus binary + configs + systemd unit get installed. You must provide your own:
	•	etcd (for metadata),
	•	object storage (MinIO, S3, GCS, etc.).

That’s why you’re seeing config sections for both — Milvus expects them to already be running.

⸻

🔹 Minimal standalone setup (DEB install)
	1.	Install/run etcd:

sudo apt-get install -y etcd-server etcd-client
etcd --data-dir=/srv/milvus-store/etcd \
     --listen-client-urls=http://127.0.0.1:2379 \
     --advertise-client-urls=http://127.0.0.1:2379 &

	2.	Install/run MinIO (object storage):

wget https://dl.min.io/server/minio/release/linux-amd64/minio
chmod +x minio
./minio server /srv/milvus-store/minio \
    --address :9000 --console-address :9001 &

	3.	Point Milvus config (/etc/milvus/configs/milvus.yaml) to those endpoints.
	4.	Start Milvus:

MILVUSCONF=/etc/milvus/configs /usr/bin/milvus run standalone


⸻

✅ So: with DEB, MinIO and etcd are your job.
If you’d rather not manage them yourself, the Docker Compose bundle is easier (it auto-deploys etcd + MinIO with Milvus).

⸻

Do you want me to write you a combined script that sets up etcd + MinIO + Milvus (all under /srv/milvus-store), so you don’t have to wire them manually every time?


	CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 MILVUSCONF=/etc/milvus/configs /usr/bin/milvus run standalone
