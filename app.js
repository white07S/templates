Good you asked â€” this trips up a lot of people.

ðŸ‘‰ Milvus itself does not install MinIO or etcd when you install from the RPM/DEB binary package.

Hereâ€™s the breakdown:
	â€¢	Docker Compose / Helm chart versions of Milvus â†’ yes, they bundle MinIO + etcd automatically as side-containers. You donâ€™t have to install them separately in those modes.
	â€¢	Bare metal / DEB / RPM package â†’ only the milvus binary + configs + systemd unit get installed. You must provide your own:
	â€¢	etcd (for metadata),
	â€¢	object storage (MinIO, S3, GCS, etc.).

Thatâ€™s why youâ€™re seeing config sections for both â€” Milvus expects them to already be running.

ðŸ”¹ Minimal standalone setup (DEB install)
	1.	Install/run etcd:

sudo apt-get install -y etcd-server etcd-client
etcd --data-dir=/srv/milvus-store/etcd \
     --listen-client-urls=http://127.0.0.1:2379 \
     --advertise-client-urls=http://127.0.0.1:2379 &

	2.	Install/run MinIO (object storage):

wget https://dl.min.io/server/minio/release/linux-amd64/minio
chmod +x minio
./minio server /srv/milvus-store/minio \
    --address :9000 --console-address :9001 &

	3.	Point Milvus config (/etc/milvus/configs/milvus.yaml) to those endpoints.
	4.	Start Milvus:

MILVUSCONF=/etc/milvus/configs /usr/bin/milvus run standalone

âœ… So: with DEB, MinIO and etcd are your job.
If youâ€™d rather not manage them yourself, the Docker Compose bundle is easier (it auto-deploys etcd + MinIO with Milvus).

Do you want me to write you a combined script that sets up etcd + MinIO + Milvus (all under /srv/milvus-store), so you donâ€™t have to wire them manually every time?
