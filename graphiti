"""
Complete Graphiti Custom Edge Testing Example - CORRECTED FOR 0.17.6

This example demonstrates how to:
1. Define custom entity types and edge types
2. Set up edge type mappings  
3. Add episodes with custom types using add_episode method
4. Search and filter by custom edge types
5. Validate the results

IMPORTANT FORMAT CHANGES FOR 0.17.6:
- entity_types: dict[str, BaseModel] (not list)
- edge_types: dict[str, BaseModel] (not list) 
- edge_type_map values: list[str] (class names as strings, not classes)
- Custom types passed to add_episode(), NOT constructor

PROTECTED ATTRIBUTE NAMES (cannot be used in custom entity types):
- uuid, name, group_id, labels, created_at, summary, attributes, name_embedding

Requirements:
- Neo4j database running (default: bolt://localhost:7687)
- OpenAI API key set in environment
- Python packages: graphiti-core==0.17.6, neo4j, openai, pydantic
