Here’s how you can set up Bun from the bun-linux-x64.zip you downloaded:

⸻

🛠️ Step-by-Step Installation

1. Unzip the archive

unzip bun-linux-x64.zip -d ~/.bun

This creates a folder like ~/.bun/bun-linux-x64/ with the binary inside.

2. Move binary to the proper place

mv ~/.bun/bun-linux-x64/bun ~/.bun/bin/
chmod +x ~/.bun/bin/bun

3. Add Bun to your PATH

Add this to your shell profile (~/.bashrc, ~/.zshrc, etc.):

export BUN_INSTALL="$HOME/.bun"
export PATH="$BUN_INSTALL/bin:$PATH"

Then apply it:

source ~/.bashrc  # or `~/.zshrc`, depending on your shell

4. Verify the installation

bun --version

You should see a version number, for example 1.2.18.

🎯 What the Official Installer Does (for Reference)

The official script from curl -fsSL https://bun.sh/install | bash:
	•	Detects your CPU architecture and AVX2 capability
	•	Downloads the correct .zip
	•	Extracts and places the binary into ~/.bun/bin
	•	Adds Bun to your PATH in your shell profile  ￼ ￼

⸻

✅ Final Check
	•	Run:

bun --help


	•	It should display Bun’s CLI usage and options.

⸻

Optional Cleanup

Once Bun’s working:

rm bunny.zip


⸻

That’s it—Bun should now be ready to go! Need help running a Bun project or using one of its tools? Just ask 😊
