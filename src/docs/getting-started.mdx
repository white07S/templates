## Installation

Follow these steps to install and set up the project:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-repo/your-project.git

# Navigate to the project directory
cd your-project

# Install dependencies
npm install
```

## Project Structure

Understanding the project structure helps you navigate the codebase effectively:
