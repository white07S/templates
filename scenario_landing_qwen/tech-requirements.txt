# UBS GCRG Scenario Landing Page - Technical Requirements Document

## Project Overview

### Application Purpose
The UBS GCRG (Group Credit Risk and Governance) Scenario platform is an advanced agentic AI system designed for operational risk scenario generation and management. The platform leverages local Large Language Models (LLMs) to provide secure, compliant risk scenario analysis within UBS infrastructure.

### Core Functionality
1. **Scenario Library Management**: Comprehensive tracking and versioning of risk scenarios across UBS taxonomy, divisions, and units
2. **Agentic Scenario Generation**: Multi-agent AI system for intelligent scenario creation and validation
3. **Local AI Processing**: Complete data sovereignty using Qwen and Mistral model families
